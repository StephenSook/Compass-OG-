## Why this matters

**368,000 foreign domestic helpers** live in Hong Kong — 9.6% of the workforce. **17% are in forced labour** (Justice Centre HK, 2016). **60% are deterred from filing Labour Tribunal claims by deportation fear** (Mission for Migrant Workers, 2023). Every time they ask for help, they hand over name + HKID + passport + employment contract — and every disclosure is subpoena-reachable by their employer. **Compass closes that gap** by letting them prove eligibility for a service without revealing who they are — using verifiable credentials, a sealed enclave, and a 0G-chain receipt that contains no identifying fields. If a court asks the clinic "who came in at 2pm last Tuesday?", the honest answer is "someone qualified for the service." That's the whole disclosure.

**TAM:** 27.2M migrant workers across APAC face similar disclosure traps (ILO, 2024). **Cost per incident**: ≈ US$22,200 lost to the worker (lost wages + recruitment debt), ≈ US$14,100 to the HK government (deflected legal aid + deportation processing).

The Phala CVM is stopped between demos to save free credits. Click **Start** in the Phala dashboard before judging — receipts cannot be minted while the CVM is off, but the historical attestation evidence is permanent (see [docs/notes/phala-deployment.md](./docs/notes/phala-deployment.md)).

---

## The "shouldn't be possible" moment

Open the [subpoena scene](https://app-psi-pied.vercel.app/clinic/subpoena). Under a PDPO §57 disclosure order, the clinic produces this and only this:

```
14:32 on May 18, 2026 — Someone qualified for free legal assistance.
That's all that exists.
```

No name. No HKID. No employer. No documents. No fields a subpoena can pry open.

---

## Maria's story

Maria works 16 hours a day in a Hong Kong apartment. When she needs free legal help, she should not have to hand over her passport, her contract, and her HKID just to ask the question. Compass lets her prove "I'm an FDH in HK with an open employment dispute" without disclosing who she is. Her credentials stay encrypted on her device. The clinic learns only a bucketed timestamp and a cryptographic commitment.

Maria is a composite — built from research, not a real person. The persona is inspired by the work of [HELP for Domestic Workers](https://helpforfdws.org/), [Bethune House Migrant Women's Refuge](https://www.bethunehouse.org/), and [Mission for Migrant Workers](https://www.migrants.net/) in Hong Kong.

## What's real / what's mocked

| Component | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| AgentRegistry contract | **real** | ERC-7857 stripped, Galileo deployed; Slither audit clean (0 sec findings) |
| CompassHub contract | **real** | policies + Authwit + receipts, Galileo deployed; 40 unit + 5 property-invariant tests pass |
| Browser AES-256-GCM encryption | **real** | live on `/onboard` step 3 — non-extractable AES-256 in IndexedDB encrypts the issued SD-JWT VC before localStorage persist; plaintext never enters localStorage |
| 0G Storage ciphertext upload | draft | AES-256-GCM round-trip on Node CLI; live 0G upload behind `COMPASS_LIVE_STORAGE=1`; browser-side upload is v2 |
| Receipt-signer service | **real** | dstack TDX dual-boot, per-receipt quote freshness binding |
| Phala Cloud TDX deploy | **real** | live: signer `0xaba6…a7e7`, composeHash `0x1884…cea0`; live state probe at [`/api/tee-status`](https://app-psi-pied.vercel.app/api/tee-status) |
| RA-quote-bound `attestationDigest` in receipts | **real** | `/api/consume` calls live Phala TEE; digest is sha256 of canonicalized receipt + per-receipt TDX quote whose `report_data` binds (signer, image, receiptId) |
| SD-JWT VC live issuer service | draft | `POST /api/issue` Ed25519-signs an SD-JWT VC when `ISSUER_PRIVATE_KEY` env set; rendered in `/vault` from localStorage |
| SD-JWT VC issuers (HELP, Bethune, Hospital) | mocked | real NGOs; signing keys are local Ed25519 fixtures, not endorsed by the NGOs |
| Authwit grant — browser-side EIP-712 signing | **real** | Privy embedded wallet signs the Compass `Grant` typed data on `/onboard` step 4 (chainId 16602, CompassHub verifying contract); no gas, no popup-required sub-flow |
| `CompassHub.consumeGrantAndIssueReceipt` — atomic on-chain | **real** | `POST /api/consume` relays Maria's signed grant; `PROVIDER_PRIVATE_KEY`-held wallet calls Galileo CompassHub; emits `GrantConsumed` + `ReceiptIssued` in one tx |
| Vercel frontend | **real** | server-rendered routes incl. `/vault`, `/about`, `/clinic/subpoena`, env-gated `/onboard` Privy + mint + issue + request-eligibility flow |
| Trust list governance | draft | v1 owner-managed via `docs/policies/*.json`; v2 DAO design specced at [`docs/trust-list-governance.md`](./docs/trust-list-governance.md) (5-of-7 quorum, 7-day timelock with 24h revoke expedite, on-chain TrustList contract on Aristotle) |
| On-chain `verifyAttestation` | stubbed | gas-prohibitive on-chain (cert chain + ECDSA + 4KB quote); off-chain via `verify-receipt` CLI is the honest substitute |
| 0G broker `processResponse` co-signature | draft | out of scope for v1; receipt has its own signature chain |
| Privy embedded wallet integration | draft | wired in `/onboard` step 1 + root provider; live behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID`, fixture timer in default build |
| `/onboard` step 2 — live `mintAgent` | draft | Privy embedded wallet → `AgentRegistry.mintAgent` on Galileo, gated on user-funded gas via faucet; fixture timer when Privy unset |
| Aristotle mainnet (chainId 16661) deploy | **real** | deployed 2026-05-11 — AgentRegistry [`0xf1FAaBef1d00Db1a15b7637Dc0d8526449D06Bf9`](https://chainscan.0g.ai/address/0xf1FAaBef1d00Db1a15b7637Dc0d8526449D06Bf9), CompassHub [`0xe42fd4F0a3197126fEeF5e6AAfC5Fb8848bBC58b`](https://chainscan.0g.ai/address/0xe42fd4F0a3197126fEeF5e6AAfC5Fb8848bBC58b); chain-selector helpers + `activeAgentRegistry`/`activeCompassHub` guards wired; `/api/consume` routes to mainnet when `NEXT_PUBLIC_COMPASS_USE_MAINNET=1` |

This table also lives at [/about](https://app-psi-pied.vercel.app/about) on the frontend with the same status badges and a live `/api/tee-status` probe above the table.

## Replicate the TEE binding yourself

**No-CLI path:** open <https://app-psi-pied.vercel.app/verify> in any browser, drop a Compass receipt-bundle JSON, click **Verify receipt →**. Your browser re-runs the four cryptographic checks below using `@noble/curves` + `@noble/hashes` — no clone, no `npm install`, no terminal. Click **Try sample** to load the bundled fixture and watch all four checks tick green in ~150ms (the page auto-swaps the composeHash to the fixture value for that case). Source: [`app/src/lib/verifyReceipt.ts`](./app/src/lib/verifyReceipt.ts).

The CLI scripts below stay as the canonical reference for anyone who'd rather verify in-terminal. Same four checks, same canonicalization, same curve library — `/verify` is a 1:1 browser port.

---

Two scripts let any judge re-verify the cryptographic chain independently. Clone, install, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StephenSook/Compass-OG-.git
cd Compass-OG-/enclave && npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### A. Verify the live deploy's attestation

```bash
npm run verify-deploy -- \
  https://65c93172e22403466eecee47dd1cc90375014a0f-8080.dstack-pha-prod9.phala.network
```

Expected output (when CVM is running):

```
[verify-deploy] /health source=tee signer=0xaba6b92ff8199275eb090c9b3049141fd431a7e7
[verify-deploy] ethAddress:    0xaba6b92ff8199275eb090c9b3049141fd431a7e7
[verify-deploy] composeHash:   0x1884e756bba03fc75f8354a04b294372c770a2720a10b7b3c6cd970a42bdcea0
[verify-deploy] running verifyReportDataBinding...
[verify-deploy] OK — quote binds to (ethAddress, composeHash)
```

Captured evidence: [docs/notes/phala-deployment.md](./docs/notes/phala-deployment.md).

### B. Verify a receipt end-to-end (offline OR live OR user-supplied bundle)

```bash
# Offline — verifies the bundled sample receipt without needing Phala running
npm run mint-sample-receipt        # generates enclave/samples/receipt-sample.json
npm run verify-receipt -- --sample \
  --expected-compose 0xabababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababab

# Live — mints a fresh receipt against the running Phala CVM and verifies it
npm run verify-receipt -- \
  --live https://65c93172e22403466eecee47dd1cc90375014a0f-8080.dstack-pha-prod9.phala.network \
  --expected-compose 0x1884e756bba03fc75f8354a04b294372c770a2720a10b7b3c6cd970a42bdcea0

# Bundle — verifies a JSON receipt someone else minted (no network needed)
npm run verify-receipt -- \
  --bundle ./path/to/received-receipt.json \
  --expected-compose 0x1884e756bba03fc75f8354a04b294372c770a2720a10b7b3c6cd970a42bdcea0
```

Expected output (PASS):

```
[verify-receipt] ✓ attestationDigest = sha256(canonicalize(receipt))
[verify-receipt] ✓ signature ECDSA-recovers to claimed signer
[verify-receipt] ✓ receipt.quoteCommitment = sha256(perReceiptQuoteHex)
[verify-receipt] ✓ quote report_data binds (signerAddress || composeHash || receiptId)
[verify-receipt] PASS — receipt verified against TEE attestation.
```

Tampering produces explicit failure codes (`REPORT_DATA_MISMATCH`, `QUOTE_COMMITMENT_MISMATCH`, `ENV_MODE_RECEIPT`, `QUOTE_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED`) — see [`enclave/src/verify-attestation.ts`](./enclave/src/verify-attestation.ts).

Out of scope (next layer): full Intel DCAP verification of the TDX quote signature chain — run via the DStack Verifier or Intel QVL externally.

### C. Tutorial — verify someone else's Compass receipt

If you've received a Compass receipt JSON (e.g., a clinic showed you
their copy and you want to independently confirm it's TEE-attested),
the verifier runs offline in <30 seconds:

```bash
# 1. Clone + install (one-time)
git clone https://github.com/StephenSook/Compass-OG-.git
cd Compass-OG-/enclave
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# 2. Save the receipt JSON to a file
#    (the bundle should contain receipt, attestationDigest,
#    signature, signerAddress, perReceiptQuoteHex)
cp /path/to/their-receipt.json ./inbound.json

# 3. Verify against the trust anchor pinned in this repo
npm run verify-receipt -- \
  --bundle ./inbound.json \
  --expected-compose 0x1884e756bba03fc75f8354a04b294372c770a2720a10b7b3c6cd970a42bdcea0
```

What you've now proven, independently of any party:

1. The receipt's `attestationDigest` is the canonical sha256 of the
   receipt — no field was tampered.
2. The signature recovers to a specific Ethereum address — that
   address is the receipt-signer.
3. The receipt's `quoteCommitment` is the sha256 of a TDX quote — the
   receipt commits to a specific TDX quote.
4. That TDX quote's `report_data` binds the (signer, image, receiptId)
   triple — defeats archived-quote replay across deployments.
5. The recovered `composeHash` matches `0x1884…cea0` — the same image
   pinned in [`docs/notes/phala-deployment.md`](./docs/notes/phala-deployment.md).

If the bundle is tampered, the CLI exits with a specific failure code
indicating which check failed. There is no graceful-degradation
fallback that hides a tamper.

## End-to-end tests

Playwright suite at `app/tests/e2e/` covers page renders, API endpoints,
and browser-side crypto. Three projects run in parallel: chromium-desktop
(1280×800) and chromium-mobile (iPhone 13 viewport).

```bash
cd app
npm install                          # one-time, includes @playwright/test
npm run test:e2e:install             # one-time, installs Chromium
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 npm run test:e2e
```

Run against a Vercel deployment (the prod URL is SSO-gated; pass the
deployment-protection bypass token):

```bash
BASE_URL=https://app-psi-pied.vercel.app \
VERCEL_BYPASS_TOKEN=<paste-from-Vercel-Settings-Deployment-Protection> \
  npm run test:e2e
```

Coverage:

| Suite | Asserts |
|---|---|
| `pages.spec.ts` | / + /about (incl. live TEE-status badge) + /vault + /clinic/subpoena + /clinic/inbox + /audit + /policies/help-legal-aid + /receipt/1 + /onboard server-render correctly |
| `api.spec.ts` | /api/tee-status returns valid mode; /api/issue 503-or-200 by env; /api/consume rejects malformed bodies cleanly |
| `crypto.spec.ts` | AES-256-GCM round-trip + GCM auth-tag tamper rejection + IndexedDB CryptoKey persist + StoredLiveCredential type-guard, all via `page.evaluate` against a live origin |

The wallet-gated flows (Privy login → mint → issue → request eligibility)
need a funded Galileo wallet and are deliberately NOT in the suite — they're
covered by manual click-through per the verification protocol in
`feedback_autonomous_verification.md`.

Drafts live at [`docs/outreach/`](./docs/outreach/README.md). Even
no-response counts: silence after a logged-and-dated send is a more
honest traction signal than no contact at all. The `Sent` and `Replied`

## Ecosystem citizenship — `compass-eligibility-check` skill

The receipt verifier above is also packaged as a reusable Claude Code /
OpenClaw skill at [`skills/compass-eligibility-check/`](./skills/compass-eligibility-check/SKILL.md).
Any agent or CI step in the 0G ecosystem can install it and ask
"is this Compass receipt valid?" without needing to clone the full repo
or wire the TEE chain by hand.

Skill inputs:

- a live Phala enclave URL — the CLI mints a fresh receipt and verifies
  the chain end-to-end (`--live` mode), OR
- the bundled sample fixture for offline demos (`--sample` mode), OR
- a `--bundle <path>` to a previously-saved receipt JSON (offline verify).

Skill output: structured JSON with `verified: true/false` plus the
recovered `signerAddress`, `composeHash`, `policyId`, `timestampBucket`,
`agentIdCommitment`, and per-check pass/fail (`attestationDigestMatch`,
`signatureRecovers`, `quoteCommitmentMatch`, `reportDataBinding`,
`composeHashTrusted`).

Why publish it as a skill: per Track 5's ecosystem-citizenship criterion,
shipping reusable primitives multiplies the project's value beyond a
single demo. The skill format means a downstream agent — clinic intake
bot, partner NGO compliance check, audit pipeline — can verify Compass
receipts with one tool call.

## Honest limits

Compass narrows disclosure but does not eliminate it. Coercion, deniable encryption, full k-anonymity against statistical re-identification, and SD-JWT VC draft churn all remain open issues. See [docs/honest-limits.md](./docs/honest-limits.md) for the full list.

The receipt-signer key is **enclave-bound** by virtue of dstack `getKey`'s deterministic-key-sealed-to-MR_TD primitive plus the per-receipt quote's `report_data = sha256(ethAddress || composeHash || receiptId)` binding. Per-receipt freshness defeats the quote-replay attack a single boot quote would leave open. Verifier-side trust chain documented in [`enclave/src/verify-attestation.ts`](./enclave/src/verify-attestation.ts).

## License + credits

MIT — see [LICENSE](./LICENSE).

Solo build by **Stephen Sookra** (Atlanta). Pair-coded with **Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context)**, adversarially reviewed by **Codex (GPT-5.5)** for security boundaries, **Gemini 2.5 Pro** for long-context audits.

Persona narrative inspired by the work of HELP for Domestic Workers, Bethune House Migrant Women's Refuge, and Mission for Migrant Workers in Hong Kong. Compass does not represent any real worker; the demo flow is a composite.

Built on the 0G APAC Hackathon, May 2026. Track 5 — Privacy & Sovereign Infrastructure.
